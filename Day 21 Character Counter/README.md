# Day 21 – Character Counter 🔢

## 📌 Description
This project implements a **Character Counter** using JavaScript that counts characters in real time while the user types.

It enforces a maximum character limit and displays a warning message when the limit is reached, similar to text inputs used in real-world applications like social media platforms.

This project is part of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**.
