# Day 15 – Simple & Compound Interest Calculator 🔁

## 📌 Description
This project is an interest calculator built using JavaScript that supports both **Simple Interest** and **Compound Interest** calculations.  
A toggle option allows users to switch between the two calculation types within the same interface.

This project is part of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge** and builds upon the previous Simple Interest calculator.
