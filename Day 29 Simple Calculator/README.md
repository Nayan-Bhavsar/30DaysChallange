# Day 29 – Calculator App 🧮

## 📌 Description
This project is a Calculator App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations and focuses on creating a clean,
well-aligned layout similar to real-world calculators.  

The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript logic handling and improve
UI structuring using CSS Grid while keeping the implementation beginner-friendly.  

This project is part of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**.
