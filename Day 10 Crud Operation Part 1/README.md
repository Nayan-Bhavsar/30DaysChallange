# Day 10 – Create & Read Users 🧾

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates the **Create and Read operations** of CRUD using **pure JavaScript**.  
A simple user form is used to collect data, which is then displayed dynamically in a table.

This project is part of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge** and focuses on understanding how data flows from a form to the UI using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
