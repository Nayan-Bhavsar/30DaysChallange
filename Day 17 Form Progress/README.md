# Day 17 – Form Progress Indicator with Validation 📊✅

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates a **Form Progress Indicator** built using JavaScript.  
It visually tracks how much of a form has been completed and performs **basic input validation** before allowing submission.

The submit button is enabled only when **all fields are filled**, and validation messages guide the user to correct input errors.

This project is part of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**.
