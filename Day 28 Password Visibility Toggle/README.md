# Day 28 – Password Visibility Toggle (Extended) 🔐

## 📌 Description
This project is an extended version of the Password Strength Checker built using JavaScript.  
It validates a password in real time based on multiple rules and allows form submission **only when the password is strong**.  

Additionally, it includes a **password visibility toggle** to show or hide the typed password, enhancing user experience.  

The goal of this project is to simulate how modern web applications handle password validation and form submission, while still using beginner-friendly JavaScript concepts.  

This project is part of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The user types a password into the input field.  
2. JavaScript checks the password against multiple rules.  
3. Each rule turns green when satisfied.  
4. A strength meter updates based on how many rules are met.  
5. The **show/hide toggle** allows users to view or hide the password.  
6. The submit button is enabled only when the password is strong.  
7. After submission, a success message is displayed.
