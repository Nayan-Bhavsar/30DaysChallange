# Day 30 – Finance Tracker App 💰

## 📌 Description
This project is a Finance Tracker App built using JavaScript.
It allows users to add income and expense transactions, delete them, and view
real-time updates of total balance, income, and expenses.

This project is designed using beginner-friendly JavaScript concepts while
maintaining a clean and professional UI.

This project is part of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge** and serves as the
