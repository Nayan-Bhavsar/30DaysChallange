# Day 20 – OTP System with Expiry Timer ⏱️

## 📌 Description
This project implements an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system with an expiry timer using JavaScript.  
The generated OTP is valid for 60 seconds, after which it automatically expires.

This project extends the OTP Generator and OTP Verification projects from previous days and demonstrates real-world authentication logic.

This project is part of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**.
