# Day 27 – Password Strength Checker 🔐

## 📌 Description
This project is an advanced Password Strength Checker built using JavaScript.
It validates a password in real time based on multiple rules and provides instant visual feedback to the user.

The goal of this project is to simulate how modern web applications guide users to create strong and secure passwords, while still using beginner-friendly JavaScript concepts.

This project is part of my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge**.
